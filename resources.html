        <div class="question" id="q1"><h4>What is drought?</h4></div>
        
        <p>Drought is a normal part of climate variability that occurs in every
type of climate. Drought is caused by a lack of precipitation over
an extended period of time, often resulting in a water shortage
for some activity, sector, or the environment. In contrast to other
environmental hazards, droughts develop slowly over a period of
weeks, months or years.</p>    
                    
<p>Drought is the second most costly weather and climate disaster
affecting the United States, preceded only by tropical cyclones. From
1980 to 2016, monetary losses caused by droughts equaled $226
billion, or 19% of total losses from natural disasters.
Drought, in conjunction with associated heat waves, also contributed
    to 2,993 deaths during that time period.<a href="#ref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
                    
<p>Although South Carolina typically receives adequate precipitation,
droughts can occur at any time of the year and last for several
months to several years. Recent droughts have impacted agriculture,
forestry, tourism, power generation, public water supply, fisheries,
and ecosystems. Drought conditions can also contribute to diminished
water and air quality, increased public health and safety risks, and
reduced quality of life and social well-being.</p>

                <div class="question" id="q3"><h4>How do we know when South Carolina is in a drought?</h4></div>
                <p>South Carolina normally experiences considerable variability
in the rainfall it receives, so it can be difficult to know exactly
when a drought is beginning, worsening, or ending. As a first
step, understanding what is “normal” can help inform those
who monitor conditions and make determinations about
whether South Carolina is in drought, or not.
Measuring droughts is difficult because they can span large
regions, vary in terms of severity and duration, and affect
different water uses and sectors at differing time scales.
South Carolina uses multiple indicators and indices to monitor
drought.</p>

            <div class="question" id="q4"><h4>What is normal precipitation for South Carolina?</h4></div>
                <p>The long-term, statewide annual precipitation average is <strong>47.66 inches.</strong></p>
                <h5>South Carolina’s precipitation varies by region.</h5>
                
                <p>The Upstate region receives the highest annual averages,
ranging from 48 inches to between 70 and 80 inches of rainfall
at the highest elevations. The central region is, on average,
the State’s driest. Annual totals are less than 48 inches. The
Coastal Plain receives annual precipitation amounts that range
from 48 to 56 inches.</p>

    show wet and dry periods. Wetter periods
    occured during the 1960s, 1970s, and
    1990s. Drier periods occurred from the
    1920s to 1950s and since the early 2000s.</p>

                <p>Average precipitation is around 3 to 5 inches per month.
Summer precipitation is normally the greatest, but can
also be the most variable since it is connected to localized
showers and thunderstorms. Fall is historically the driest
season. Tropical storms and hurricanes, many of which occur
in the fall, can be “drought-busters.” Winter and spring
                    precipitation occurs mostly through frontal systems.<a href="#ref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

                <div class="question" id="q5"><h4>What causes droughts in South Carolina?</h4></div>
                <p>Drought in South Carolina can begin during any season.
Seasonal variability is often associated with variations in
weather patterns, such as changes in pressure, storm tracks,
and the jet stream. Other factors, such as extreme heat,
wind, and evapotranspiration rates, can also influence the
development of droughts.</p>
                <p>For the Southeast, the strength and placement of the Bermuda
High, a semi-permanent subtropical area of high pressure in
the Atlantic Ocean, influences rainfall conditions particularly
in spring and summer. Intensification and shifts in this highpressure
system has been linked to shifts in storm tracks,
                    decreased summer precipitation, and drought conditions.<a href="#ref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
                <p>The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is another climate
phenomenon that influences dry and wet spells in the State.
ENSO fluctuates between three phases: Neutral, cooling La
Niña, and warming El Niño. Extremes of these oscillations
cause extreme weather. In the southeastern United States
winter precipitation tends to be enhanced during the warm
phase (El Niño) and reduced during the cold phase (La
Niña). There is a less consistent signal during fall and no
evident connection between ENSO and spring and summer
                    precipitation.<a href="#ref"><sup>6</sup></a> The La Niña stage can be an aid for forecasting
                    seasonal droughts in the region.<a href="#ref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

                    <p>The multi-year drought that began in 2007 was
            accompanied by high summer temperatures and
            affected the entire Southeast region. US Drought
            Monitor authors use data available from multiple
            sources to create the weekly map.</p>
                            <p><strong>Spatial extent:</strong> All South Carolina counties can be affected
            by drought. Droughts can extend beyond single states into
            multi-state regions.</p>
                            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Short-term droughts last less than six months
            and bring agricultural impacts, especially when occurring
            during growing season. Long-term droughts last more than
            six months and can last for many years, affecting hydrology,
            ecology, and societal
            well-being.</p>
                            <p><strong>Severity (or Intensity):</strong> Many different indicators and
            methods are used to measure and monitor drought severity.
            The choice of an indicator may depend on the type of
            drought being considered, the impacts of most interest, and
            the region or location in which drought is occurring. Due to
            drought’s complexity, multiple indicators are often used to
            depict severity.</p>

                <p><strong>Indicators</strong> are values used to describe drought conditions, using precipitation, stream flow, groundwater and reservoir levels, or soil
moisture information.</p>
                <p><strong>Indices</strong> are computed numerical representations of drought severity, using climatic or hydrological data as inputs. For example, the
South Carolina Drought Response Committee uses the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Crop Moisture Index (CMI), Keetch-Byram
Drought Index (KBDI), Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), and US Drought Monitor (USDM).</p>
                <p>An <strong>impact</strong> is an observable loss or change at a specific time due to drought. Examples include crop loss or damage, closed boat ramps
due to low lake levels, or burning restrictions due to higher fire risks.</p>
