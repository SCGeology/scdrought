# scdrought
Development of a new SC Drought website for the SCDNR State Climate Office. 

Starting with a template from StartBootstrap and working from there. Leaflet and ESRI leaflet for map interaction. Map data hosted on ArcGIS Online. Heatmap Grid developed with plotly... this is a 'proof of concept'... might not keep it.
